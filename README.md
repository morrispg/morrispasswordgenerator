# morrispasswordgenerator

Welcome to my password generator, created for a project in my EdX bootcamp. This project helped me understand the use of pseudocode to develop a framework. Learning how to concat different functions was also a great tool to learn. I better understand the importance of functions and am happy to have gained better understanding of them. These skills will assist me in my career as a programmer. The code I used in this assignment is a combination of my own with help from other students, TAs, Gary and tutors. It takes a village.
